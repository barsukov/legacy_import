#Every models are automaticaly included to import with base setings
#if you need to customize some default settings you need to add your model into this config file with prefix Legacy

LegacyImport.config do |config|


################  Global configuration  ################

# Exclude specific models (keep the others):
# config.excluded_models = [<%= LegacyModel.all.map{|am| "'#{am.model}'" }.join(', ') %>]

# Include specific models (exclude the others):

################  Model configuration  ################

# Each model configuration can alternatively:
#   - stay here in a `config.model 'ModelName' do ... end` block
#   - go in the model definition file in a `rails_admin do ... end` block

# This is your choice to make:
#   - This initializer is loaded once at startup (modifications will show up when restarting the application) but all RailsAdmin configuration would stay in one place.
#   - Models are reloaded at each request in development mode (when modified), which may smooth your RailsAdmin development workflow.


# Now you probably need to tour the wiki a bit: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki
# Anyway, here is how RailsAdmin saw your application's models when you ran the initializer:
